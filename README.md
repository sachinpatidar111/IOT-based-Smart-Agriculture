The IoT-based Smart Agriculture System is a solution for monitoring and controlling various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light, in a farm or greenhouse. The system uses sensors and actuators to collect data from the environment and perform actions, such as turning on or off a water pump or a heater, based on the collected data. The collected data is transmitted to a cloud server for storage and analysis, and users can access this data using a mobile app or a web interface.
